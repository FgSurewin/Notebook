# Real Function

4. **What is a real number? What is a function? Use the concepts of domain and range to explain your answer. What is a real function?**

- Real number

A real number is a value of a continuous quantity that can represent a distance along a line, which includes rational numbers and irrational numbers.

- Function

It's like a machine that has an input and an output. And the output is related somehow to the input. Here, the input is the domain and the output is the range.

- The real function:

A function from a set A to a set B is a relation that assigns to each element $x$ in the set A **exactly** one element $y$ in the set B

5. **What does it mean for a function to be one-to-one?**

A one-to-one function is a function in which the answers never repeat.

6. **Give three examples of real functions that are one-to-one. Explain your answer.**

Note:$ y = f(x)$ is a function if it passes the **vertical line test**. It is a one-to-one function if it passes both the **vertical line test** and the **horizontal line test**.

All of them passed the test.

- $f(x)=x$

- $f(x)=x^3$

- $f(x)=2^x$

7. **Give three examples of real functions that are not one-to-one. Explain in each case how you know the function is not one-to-one.**

Three examples of functions are not One-to-One because they didn't pass the vertical test or horizontal test.

- $f(x)=x^2$

- $f(x)=|x|$

- $f(x)=\sin(x)$

8. **What is an inverse function? What kind of function has an inverse? How are inverse functions defined?**

An inverse function is a function that undoes the action of the another function. A function $g(x)$ is the inverse of a function $f(x)$ if whenever $y=f(x)$ then $x=g(y)$.

In other words, the domain of $f(x)$ is the range of $g(x)$.

A function $f$ has an inverse function only if for every $y$ in its range there is only one value of $x$ in the domain for $f(x)=y$. This inverse function is unique and is frequently denoted by $f^{-1}$

In short, if the function is one-to-one function, it has an inverse function.

9. **Does the real quadratic function $f(x)=x^2$ have an inverse on its domain? Explain your answer. What needs to be done in order to define an inverse for this function?**

Depending to the specific domain you chose. If you are talking about the whole domain, there is no inverse on this interval.

In order for the $y=x^2$ function to have an inverse function, we have to limit the domain to $(-\infty,0] $ or $[0, \infty)$

The graph is showed below:

- When the domain is $(-\infty,0]$

The red line is the shape of the function $y=x^2$ and the black one is the inverse function.

- When the domain is $[0, \infty)$

The green line is the shape of the function $y=x^2$ and the purple one is the inverse function.

10. **Does the real sine function have an inverse on its domain? Why or why not?**

In the whole domain $(-\infty, \infty)$, sine function dose not have an inverse function. However, it did have inverse function in a specific domain.

In order for the $y=sin(x)$ to have an inverse function, we need to restrict the domain to $[-\frac{\pi}{2},\frac{\pi}{2}]$ where the range is $[-1,1]$.
