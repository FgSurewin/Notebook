12. **Complete Table 1 . What happens to the value of $\left(1+\frac{1}{n}\right)^{n}$ as $n$ grows large? Give the value of the limit to five decimal places. Define the limiting value to be the natural exponential base $e$.**

| $n$       | $(1+\frac{1}{n})^{n}$ |
| --------- | --------------------- |
| 1         | 2                     |
| 10        | 2.593742460           |
| 100       | 2.704813829           |
| 1,000     | 2.716923932           |
| 10,000    | 2.718145927           |
| 100,000   | 2.718268237           |
| 1,000,000 | 2.718280469           |

**Definition 2 (The Natural Exponential Base $e$)** We define the (**natural exponential base**) $e$ by the limit

$$e := \lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}\left(1+\frac{1}{n}\right)^{n}=2.718281828$$

13. **Strontium 90 is a radioactive isotope that decays exponentially according to the function**

$$A(t)=A_0 e^{(-0.024)t}$$

**where $A_0$ is the initial quantity (measured in grams) at time $t=0$ and $A(t)$ is the amount present at time $t\geq0$ in years. Suppose that a scientist has a sample of Strontium 90 measuring 500 grams.**

**(a) What is the decay rate of Strontium 90?**

The decay rate of Strontium 90 is $-0.024$

**(b) How much Strontium 90 does the scientist have left after 10 years?**

$$A(t)=500 e^{(-0.024)\cdot 10}=393.3139306$$

**(c) How much Strontium 90 does the scientist have left after 20 years?**

$$A(t)=500 e^{(-0.024)\cdot 20}=309.3916959$$

**(d) What is the half--life of Strontium 90?**

$$A(t)=500 e^{(-0.024)\cdot t}=250$$

$$t=28.88113252$$
