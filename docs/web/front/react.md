**Theorem 1 (Pythagorean Theorem)**

For any right triangle, if $c$ is the length of the hypotenuse and if $a$ and $b$ are the lengths of the remaining two sides, then the following equation holds:

$$a^2+b^2=c^2$$

2. **Draw a right triangle with hypotenuse of length 1. Label one of the non-square angles $\theta$. Label the side opposite to $\theta$ with $\sin\theta$. Label t**
